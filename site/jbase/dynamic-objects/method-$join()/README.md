# Method: $join()

<PageHeader />

## Description

The **\$join()** method is the opposite of **$split()**. It takes a Dynamic Objects array and re-assembles each value into a single string. A delimiter, if specified, will be placed between each value that is joined.

## Syntax

```
arr->$join(delimiter)
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| delimiter | The character(s) used to join the values of the array to a string |

## Return value

A string

Below is an example using the **\$split()** method on a string to create an array, and then using the **\$join()** method to re-assemble the array into a single string.  
The example also shows how similar functionality to **$split()** can be achieved using the **for ... in ...** construct, but of course the new **\$split()** is easier to use and supports multiple delimiters.

## Examples

```
    source = "Mary,Had,A,Little,Lamb"
    arr = source->$split(",")
    crt arr->$tojson(1)
*
* Re-assemble the dynamic array using $join()
*
    source2 = arr->$join(",")
*
* Display the original source, then the re-assembled source.
*
    crt "source  = ":source
    crt "source2 = ":source2
*
* Now to split the original string, not using $split(), but using the for ... in ... construct
* This is simply an exercise in showing how this construct can be used.
*
    arr2 = new array
    for value.next in source using ","
        arr2->$append(value.next)
    next value.next
    crt arr2->$tojson(1)
```

Results:

```
[
        "Mary",
        "Had",
        "A",
        "Little",
        "Lamb"
]
source  = Mary,Had,A,Little,Lamb
source2 = Mary,Had,A,Little,Lamb
[
        "Mary",
        "Had",
        "A",
        "Little",
        "Lamb"
]
```
